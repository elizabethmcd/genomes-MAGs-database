# Creating a database of reference genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs)

This repository is mostly a description of how to build a database of reference genomes from Refseq and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from multiple large-scale metagenomic projects from various environments. This database does not include human or host associated MAGs, and is mostly for exploring genomes/marker genes of environmental metagenomes. The included scripts cover downloading and reformatting sets of genomes, and subsequently calling genes or performing functional annotations for a specific subset of downloaded genomes for further analyses. 

_Refseq database built in July 2019. As of this date, downloading all complete Refseq genomes and MAGs from the below datasets amounts to approximately 30,000 genomes._

## Data

- `ncbi-bioproject-files/` contains individual bioproject accession information for all datasets, from which genomes were downloaded through `ncbi-genome-download` and used to merge metadata
- `bioproject-accession-lists/` contains accession lists for each bioproject, and the combined list for bulk download
- `metadata/` more detaild metadata information on specific metagenomic projects and downloaded genomes from NCBI
